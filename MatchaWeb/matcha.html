            <h1>🌿 Introduction to Matcha : </h1>
            <p>Matcha is more than just a trendy green powder—it is a vibrant, finely ground tea made from specially grown and processed green tea leaves. Unlike regular green tea where you steep the leaves and toss them away, matcha is whisked into water or milk, and you drink the whole leaf. That is why it packs a stronger flavor, more antioxidants, and a long list of health benefits. Originating from Japan, Kyoto, matcha has deep roots in Zen Buddhist culture and the Japanese tea ceremony, where every movement in preparing and serving matcha is intentional and meditative. But today, matcha has traveled far beyond tradition—it's now in cafes, smoothies, lattes, desserts, and even skincare!</p>

        <h1> 🍃 Matcha Production Process </h1>
        <h2> Matcha is made with care, precision, and centuries of tradition. Here is how it goes from leaf to powder:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>🌱 Grow <br>
                Matcha starts with specially cultivated tencha tea plants. These plants are grown in nutrient-rich soil, often in Japan, specifically, Uji, Nishio, or Shizuoka regions. The focus is on quality, not quantity—farmers give a lot of attention to the health of the leaves.
            </li>
            <li>🌤️ Shade<br>
                About 3 to 4 weeks before harvest, the plants are shaded from direct sunlight using straw, bamboo screens, or black netting. This reduces photosynthesis, which boosts the chlorophyll and L-theanine content. It gives matcha its deep green color and rich, umami flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                ✂️ Harvest<br>
                Only the youngest, topmost leaves are hand-picked. These are the softest and most flavorful. Timing is crucial—harvest happens once a year, usually in early spring.
            </li>
            <li>
                🌀 Blend and Grind<br>
            After drying, leaves are carefully blended for consistent taste and color. Then, they're ground into an ultra-fine powder using traditional stone mills. It is slow—each mill only produces about 40g per hour—but this preserves flavor and nutrients.
            </li>
            <li>✂️ Shift and Cut (De-stemming)<br>
                Before grinding, the dried leaves are sorted to remove stems and veins, leaving only the soft leaf part. This cleaned product is called tencha, and it ensures smooth texture in the final matcha.
            </li>
            <li>♨️ Steam and Dry<br>
                Right after harvest, leaves are steamed to stop oxidation (unlike green teas that are pan-fired). This locks in color and nutrients. Then they are dried gently, preserving their natural qualities.'
            </li>
        </ol>

            <h1>🏯History of Matcha : </h1>
            <p>Matcha was introduced to Japan in 1191 by Zen monk Eisai, who brought tea seeds and the powdered tea method from China’s Song Dynasty. In 1214, he presented his book Kissa Yōjōki ("Drinking Tea for Health") to the Kamakura shogun, promoting tea as a form of medicine. At the time, tea leaves were steamed and roasted overnight, resulting in a dark lump tea that was ground and consumed much like modern matcha—though its color and processing were different.
                The term matcha (抹茶) itself didn’t appear until much later, first recorded in a Japanese dictionary in 1548, during the Muromachi period. While similar terms like mòchá (末茶) appeared in Chinese texts a century after Eisai, there’s no clear evidence linking them directly to the Japanese word.
                Eisai’s disciple, Myōe, planted the first tea seeds in Togano’o, Kyoto, where the tea gained high reputation and was called honcha ("real tea"). He later established plantations in Uji, which became and remains the most famous matcha-producing region in Japan.

      <div class="grades" id="grades">
        <h1>🍵Grades of Matcha :</h1>
        <h2>There are three main grades of matcha from the highest, respectively - Ceremonial Grade, Premium Grade, and Culinary Grade</h2>
        <div class="grades-container">
            <div class="grades-item">
                <img src="Assets/ceremonial.jpg" alt="Ceremonial Grade">
                <h3>Ceremonial Grade</h3>
                <p>Harvested in early spring, ceremonial grade matcha is made from the youngest leaves located at the top of the plant. These leaves are shade-grown to boost chlorophyll, giving the powder its vibrant green color and smooth, umami-rich taste. With a naturally sweet and mellow flavor, this matcha is traditionally whisked with hot water and enjoyed on its own. It's the type of matcha used in Japanese tea ceremonies, and perfect for those who appreciate the full depth and tradition of high-quality matcha.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grades-item">
                <img src="Assets/premium.jpg" alt="Premium Grade">
                <h3>Premium Grade</h3>
                <p>Picked slightly later in the season, premium grade matcha still uses high-quality leaves but includes a few that are a bit more mature. The result is a fine powder with a beautiful green hue and a slightly bolder, earthy, and grassy flavor than ceremonial grade. It strikes a balance between taste and affordability, making it great for daily drinking. Add it to your morning lattes, smoothies, or even iced matcha drinks — it’s smooth enough to sip, but strong enough to pair well with milk, honey, and anything you would like.</p>

                <img src="Assets/culinary.jpg" alt="Culinary Grade">
                <h3>Culinary Grade</h3>
                <p>Harvested from more mature leaves that are often picked later in the season, culinary grade matcha has a deeper green tone, with strong, earthy, slightly bitter flavor. While it's not as smooth as the higher grades, its boldness is exactly what makes it ideal for cooking. Designed to hold its own when mixed with other ingredients, it shines in baking, desserts, smoothies, and savory recipes. Think matcha brownies, ice cream, or matcha pancakes — anywhere you want the matcha flavor to really stand out.</p>
